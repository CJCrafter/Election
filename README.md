## ZK-Elections

Developed for the [Civic Tech hackathon](https://techfc.org/civic-tech-hack/2024-2/) hosted 
by Boston University and Howard University on February 17-18, 2024. This project is a web 
application that allows users to vote in elections using zero-knowledge proofs.

This allows for secure and anonymous voting, while also ensuring complete transparency and
verifiability of the election results.

## What is a Zero-Knowledge Proof?
A zero-knowledge proof is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party
(the verifier) that they know a value `x`, without revealing any information about `x`. This is
accomplished by using a cryptographic protocol that allows the prover to convince the verifier
that they know the value `x`, without actually revealing `x` itself.

For elections, this means that a voter can prove that they voted for a particular candidate
without revealing which candidate they voted for. This allows for secure and anonymous voting,
while also ensuring that the election results are verifiable and accurate.

More information about zero-knowledge proofs can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof).
